# Employee Burnout Analysis

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze employee burnout using various features such as mental fatigue score, resource allocation, and work-from-home setup availability. By training and evaluating multiple machine learning models, we predict the burnout rate and identify the most significant factors contributing to employee burnout.

## Data
The dataset used for this project is stored in the file `employee_burnout_analysis.xlsx`. It contains the following columns:
- `Employee ID`
- `Date of Joining`
- `Gender`
- `Company Type`
- `WFH Setup Available`
- `Designation`
- `Resource Allocation`
- `Mental Fatigue Score`
- `Burn Rate`

Make sure to place the data file in the project directory before running the analysis.

## Tools and Libraries
The project is implemented using the following tools and libraries in Google Colab:
- `pandas` for data manipulation
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization
- `scikit-learn` for machine learning models and evaluation metrics
- `numpy` for numerical operations

## Data Preprocessing
1. **Handling Non-Numeric Data**: Convert non-numeric columns to numeric.
2. **Handling Missing Values**: Fill missing values with appropriate values.
3. **Feature Scaling**: Standardize the features for better model performance.

## Models and Evaluation
### Linear Regression
Linear regression is used to predict the burnout rate based on the features.

### K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Regression
KNN regression is used to predict the burnout rate based on the nearest neighbors.

## Visualization and Insights
Visualizing the relationships between features and the target variable can provide valuable insights.

## Conclusion
By applying linear regression and KNN regression models, we can predict the burnout rate of employees. The project helps in identifying key factors that influence employee burnout, providing insights that can be used to improve employee well-being and productivity.

## Future Work
1. **Model Improvement**: Try more advanced models like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or Neural Networks.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features or transform existing ones to improve model performance.
3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize model parameters to achieve better accuracy.
