# Employee Burnout Analysis

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze employee burnout using various features such as mental fatigue score, resource allocation, and work-from-home setup availability. By training a machine learning model, we predict the burnout rate and evaluate the factors contributing to it.

## Data
The dataset used for this project contains the following columns:
- `Employee ID`
- `Date of Joining`
- `Gender`
- `Company Type`
- `WFH Setup Available`
- `Designation`
- `Resource Allocation`
- `Mental Fatigue Score`
